# Territory
I was working on an engine, for a roguelike, but I couldn't really come up with a good idea for a game. So here is the engine part I made. It's really basic, but supports fast chunked tiles, layers, loads basic exported tmx 'structures' and supports 'renderables' on the map, like a player. Feel free to use it, CC0, tell me if you do :)
